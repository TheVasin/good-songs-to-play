Verse 1:

    Am C Dm
    Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
    G G7 C Em/B
    Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
    Am C Dm
    When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
    G C
    Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

Pre-Chorus:

    Em/B Am Em
    It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
    Bb C/G
    Mmm too young, too dumb to realize

Chorus:

    G F G C
    That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
    F G C
    Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
    F G Am
    Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
    D7 F Fm C
    Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
    F C Em/B

Verse 2:

    Am C Dm
    My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
    G G7 C Em/B
    Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
    Am C Dm
    Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made ooh
    G C
    And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Pre-Chorus:

    Em/B Am Em
    It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
    Bb C/G
    Mmm too young, too dumb to realize

Chorus:

    G F G C
    That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
    F G C
    Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
    F G Am
    Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
    D7 F Fm C
    Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Bridge:

    F G C G/B Am Em/G
    Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
    D7
    Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
    Dm
    To try and apologize for my mistakes
    G
    But I just want you to know

Chorus:

    F G C
    I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
    F G C
    Give you all his hours when he has the chance
    F G Am
    Take you to every party cause I remember how much you love to dance
    D7 F Fm C
    Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
    D7 F Fm C
    Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
